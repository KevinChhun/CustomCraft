CustomCraft

Many online marketplaces focus on selling pre-made items, which leaves little room for customers who want something unique or personalized. People sometimes want a product in a specific style, but it doesn't exist
on the marketplace. Current systems for commissioning work are often done through social media or informal messaging, which could be disorganized and unreliable for the artist and customer.

CustomCraft addresses this issue by providing an application where users can request custom-made items and artists can earn some income from commissions. The goal of this project is to be able to give a way of
customers being able to gain an item they've longed for, and for artists to get paid for their hard work in the process. By creating a user-friendly platform, CustomCraft helps customers turn their ideas into reality
while giving artists a reliable way to showcase their skills and earn income.
